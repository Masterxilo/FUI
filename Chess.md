I've been thinking about how to make a multimodal chess interface for the last couple of days. It's not a very flashy idea but it offers lots of possibilites. In this it's similar to the multimodal bejeweled from last year's class. Here's what I've got so far:

**Chess programs:**

Looks nice, offers some possibilites to change the visuals. Not too many functionalities. Sadly you have to drag the figures to make a move this might be important when creating the interface.

 <http://www-lucaschess.rhcloud.com/index><http://www-lucaschess.rhcloud.com/index> Very basic look, almost too many functions(nice because we could implement more, bad because despite how good our interface is it still might be confusing), allows to move pieces by dragging or by clicking on a piece and then on the destination.

**Modalities we could compare:**

**1: unmodified(mouse)**

Should be looked at to be able to make comparisons.

**2: pen/touch**

Basicaly just plug in a touchscreen. Not very interesting but would work pretty well and minimal work on our part.

**3: voice**

Control the menu and the pieces with voice commands. To move a piece say for example "B7 move to A1" or "Queen move to B2". The second example is a bit problematic since there are pieces that are multiple times on the board and it has to be clear which one is meant.

**4: d-Touch+voice**

Make models of all the pieces. Display the board on the screen, place the models on their place and track them with d-touch. Move the models to control the figures. The menu is accessed with voice commands.
 
**5: voice + pen/touch**
Control the pieces with the touchscreen. Use voice to access the menu additionaly. (The menu could still be used with the touchscreen)
